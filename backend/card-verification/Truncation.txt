As human verification is necessary to see if card is damaged, this part is truncated
Below is a process of the human verification:
- verifier will have a UI that lists the card verification DB
- Each document(requestId) will have a 'status' field = 'pending' or 'complete'
- 'pending' documents will be red while completed will be green so verifier knows which to verify
- verifier can open the imageURL and perform the verification
- he will then have a dropdown box(inspectionResult) to select 'damaged', 'good condition'
- when he hits submit, a POST update-result is made to card-verification microservice
- the POST includes requestId and inspectionResult
- card verification will update the DB status, inspectionResult and updated timestamp
